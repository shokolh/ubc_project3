# Street Trees in Vancouver
## INTRODUCTION

I have a dog and walk in my neighbourhood with him every day. Streets around my house are nicely treed and beautiful. I enjoy cherry bloosoms in the spring, especially when petals come off the trees and dance around in the air!

There are downsides though...many people are allergic to tree pollens, and unfortunately, I'm one of them...Also, as we experience more and more severe weather conditions in recent years, I am worried that trees that are tall and old might fall down from strong gusts of wind.

I am using a subset of the Vancouver Street Trees. (5000 records/trees) for my data analysis and visualization. The data was obtained from Open Data Portal that the city of Vancouver provides, and follows an Open Government Licence â€“ Vancouver

Here comes my questions of interests about street trees in Vancouver.

## Questions of Interests

1. I have seasonal allergies and wonder if the city has recently planted more trees that produce common allergens? (see {numref}`allergies`)
2. What is the most common type of tree the city has been planting? How are trees distributed in neighbourhoods?
3. In recent years, we've been having more severe weather conditions. Are our street trees safe? How old are they? Where are tall trees located?
4. Where can I enjoy "Hanami" (Cherry blossom viewing) in the spring? (see {numref}`cherry_blossoms`)
