I love and enjoy street trees in Vancouver. However, just like everything else in the world, there are good sides and bad sides of it.

The bad side is...I get pretty severe allergy symptoms from grass and trees, and I wonder whether the city is planting more and more trees that produce lots of pollen. If so, it would be bad news for me...Fortunately, if you look at {numref}`q1_fig1` below, the city is not particularly planting more of those types of trees, which makes me somewhat relieved.

The balance of allergen and non-allergen planted trees has been consistent
```

<u>Equation:</u>

```{math}
:label: eq_txt_1
\text{Average number of planted trees per year}
=
\frac{\text{Total number of planted trees}}{\text{Number of years}}
```

Equation {eq}`eq_txt_1` is to get the average number of planted trees per year.


In {numref}`q2_fig2` below, you can find that the most common type/genus the city has been planting on streets is ACER. I don't think anyone argues with this one! ACER is a maple tree and that's what Canada is all about! Not only are our street trees nice, but they are also so beautiful in the fall.

ACER (Maple) is the most common genus for Vancouver street trees. Oh, Canada!!!

I have placed street trees in {numref}`q3_map1` in Question 3. I am not sure if this map helps identify dangerous trees that might fall down in the conditions of stormy weather we've been experiencing recently. There are so many other factors that cause trees to fall down...

Street trees by height range

```

<u>Equation:</u>

```{math}
:label: eq_txt_2
\text{Percentage(%)}
=
\frac{\text{Number of trees in the height range}}{\text{Total number of planted trees}}
```

Equation {eq}`eq_txt_2` is to get the percentage(%) of the planted trees in the particular height range.


Finally, here's something more fun and enjoyable for you! You can identify cherry trees in {numref}`q4_map2` - Cherry trees on Vancouver streets in the last section of Question 4. I recommend to use this map when the season arrives in March or April. My favourites are Somei-Yoshino (popular kind) which is so beautiful, and "late bloomers" which have darker pink petals and their flowers are gourgeous!

I am not 100% satisfied with the visualizations presented in this report. For example, I don't know exactly which tree types are causing my allergy symptoms. I could improve the analysis and visualization if I spent more time on research to find out more information about tree allergies instead of just using some general ideas from websites. Also, adding some images of trees and flowers would make the report more interesting, but overall, it was a really good exercise and I am sure that I learnt a lot by doing this project. Thank you so much!
